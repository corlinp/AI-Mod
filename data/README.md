# AI Mod's Datasets

`condensed_spam_data.csv` A small random subset of the multi-gigabyte AI Mod spam dataset (not yet publicly available). Reasonably as accurate as the full thing in training.

`corpus.txt` A list of not-swear-words that will be whitelisted from profanity filters

`profanity_dict.csv` A very large dataset of offensive words. Work is being made on classifying them by category and level of offensiveness.

`trolling_data.csv` A dataset of known trolling/good comments assembled from Wikipedia and other public datasets.
